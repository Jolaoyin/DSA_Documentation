# DSA_Documentation

## This is where i started my Portfolio building while taking my DSA Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

## I have learnt quite a numbernof things ranging from Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolo building.

## Project Topic: E Commerce

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year. By analysing the varioous parameters in the data received we seekto gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.
